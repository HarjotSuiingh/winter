# Project Name

E-ink Smart Display


## Summary


What are you going to build? What does it do? Why are you excited to build it?


I am going to build an e-ink smart display which is powered by a Rasberry pi. It will be able to act as a display where I can view things such as my calendar and control smart home items that I have whilst also acting as an e-reader making it an all in one device. I am excited for this build because it will allow me to have one device for which I can do everything I need to do which would just make my life simpler.


## Plan


What steps are you going to take to build it? What tools are you going to use? What will you do first, second, third, etc.?


For this project I will be following different tutorials and websites with steps that I have linked below. Essentially, this project will require a Rasberry pi which I already own as well as a Rasberry pico since my pi is a slightly older version and might not be able to run the weather display. I will be connecting the Rasberry pi to the display using a kindle pw due to the display being very high quality and having features such as temperature control. This would be achieved through the kindlepi/kindleberry tutorial. However, I also have an e-ink display which is slightly worse quality I can connect to the pi if I am unable to use the first method as a backup. I will then place this into an ikea frame I already own using some double sided tape and screws to secure the display in the frame. After this I will program the Rasberry pi to be able to display things such as weather. Specifically, I would need to make a rested api on my local network which I will link to my Amazon Alexa through IFTTT.
